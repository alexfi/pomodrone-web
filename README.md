## Usage

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html) and [Git](http://git-scm.com) on your machine. If you're a Windows user you'll also need to install [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads).
2. [Install Gulp](http://Gulpjs.com/) using `npm install -g gulp`. You may need to use `sudo` in front of the Gulp install command to give it permissions.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`. You don't need `sudo` to do this.
5. Run `gulp` in your project directory to automatically run FastShell's Gulp tasks.
